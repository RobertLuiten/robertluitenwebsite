    <h1 className="font-bold text-xl">Whomever is Robert Luiten Perchance?</h1>
    <br></br>
    <p>Robert Luiten is perhaps the greatest mind of this generation. Considered by many to be the modern day contemporary
      of Socrates&#44; DaVinci&#44; and Abraham Lincoln&#44; Robert has inspired awe and wonder into all of those he meets. He&apos;s really
      smart and handsome and rich and everyone loves him. And that&apos;s on god fr fr.

    <p>But how did he become the man he is today?</p>
    <br></br>
    <h1 className="font-bold text-xl">Early Life</h1>
    <br></br>
    <p>Robert was born in Sussex&#44; Britian on October 14th&#44; 1991 to his loving mother Queen Elizabeth II and her secret lover&#44;
      Scrimble The Love Wizard. Unfortunately&#44; due to the circumstances of which Robert was conceived&#44; and the position that
      his mother held&#44; Queen Elizabeth II abondoned her son and left him to be raised by the dastardly Scrimble The Love Wizard.
      Scrimble The Love Wizard and Robert did some crazy stuff or something I think they made a flying car.
